mahotas-imread: Read Image Files
================================

Mahotas-imread is a simple module with a small number of functions:

imread
    Reads an image file
imread_multi
    Reads an image file with multiple images. Currently, TIFF and STK (a TIFF
    sub-based format) support this function.
imsave
    Writes an image file

Example (which uses `mahotas <http://luispedro.org/software/mahotas>`__ for
Gaussian filtering)::


    from imread import imread, imsave
    from mahotas import gaussian_filter
    lena = imread('lena.jpeg')

    lena = gaussian_filter(lena.astype(float), 4.)
    imsave('lena-filtered.jpeg', lena)


This grew out of frustration at current image loading solutions in Python, in
either my packages [`mahotas <http://mahotas.rtfd.org>`__] or packages from
others [`scikit-image <http://scikit-image.org/>`__, for example].

The relationship with numpy is very contained and this could be easily
repurposed to load images in other frameworks, even other programming
languages.

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To compile on debian/ubuntu::

    sudo apt-get install libpng12-dev libtiff4-dev libwebp-dev
    sudo apt-get install xcftools

To compile on Mac::

    sudo port install libpng tiff webp

Either way, you can then compile with::

    python setup.py build

and install with::

    python setup.py install

On Windows, you can also just download a pre-built package from `C. Gohlke's
repository <http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#imread>`__
